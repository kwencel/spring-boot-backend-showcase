# This is a special changelog used by tests and also by the application if it is run using the default properties.
# It is done to provide the application with some example data to showcase its functionality.
#
# The default properties expects a DB running on localhost (provided by the docker-compose.yml) so it is assumed to be
# temporary DB. The same goes for tests, which use testcontainers.
#
# For this reason, this changelog and the CSV files are expected to contain only the latest desired state of the test
# data, without versioning it like it is usually done in Liquibase.
#
# Having all test data in one place, as opposed to versioning it with the rest of the changelog, makes it easier to
# understand just by glancing at the CSV files.
